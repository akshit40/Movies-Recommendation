Movie Recommendation System
This project involves the development of a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. The system aims to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their viewing history and preferences.

Features
User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies by finding users with similar tastes and suggesting films they have liked.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Suggests movies that are similar to the ones the user has rated highly in the past.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on the metadata (genre, director, actors, etc.) of movies the user has previously watched.
Hybrid Approach: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for more accurate recommendations.
Interactive Interface: User-friendly interface for users to input their preferences and view recommendations.
Data Visualization: Visualizes user preferences and recommendation patterns with charts and graphs.
Real-Time Recommendations: Updates recommendations in real-time as user preferences change.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for implementing the algorithms.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
Scikit-Learn: Machine learning library for implementing recommendation algorithms.
